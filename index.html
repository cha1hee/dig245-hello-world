        shortcuts used in video editing. There was also a list of more keyboard s
        hortcuts that can be used for a faster work flow in general computer usage.
        Keyboard shortcuts will save time once you learn them well, and will be
        especially helpful for website making since it is such an iterative process.

        The second learn-computing activity I did was The Filesystem. This
        activity first defined files, folders, programs, force quit, and users.
        Then it talked about how files are organized using the hierarchical
        filesystems. This means that there is an address to each file path, in
        which the paths are much like a node tree. I make this comparison because
        there is a root folder and the folders/files inside those folders are
        like the child of the folder. Then we learned about permission and how to
        view what user has the permission to read, write, and execute. There is a
        table that includes all the extensions of common files and how ot view
        hidden files. Another note to make from this activity is that using iCloud
        is highly discouraged.

        <h3>Intriguing Web-Based Projects</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The Bored Button: <a
            href="https://www.boredbutton.com"
            target="_blank">https://www.boredbutton.com</a> <br>
            This project constantly comes up with links that of fun activities
            and games you can do/play, it's like a randomized online arcade. It's
            basically a website that either finds games for you to play or has a long
          list of games to suggest.</li>
          <li>Hacker Typer: <a
            href="https://hackertyper.net"
            target="_blank">https://hackertyper.net</a> <br>
            This is a fairly simple project, basically what happens is the webiste
            takes any keystroke that a user inputs and adds a specified ammount of
            characters to the screen. There is no correlation to the keys and what
            appears. You can upload files to the website to have a different code
            typed on the screen.</li>
          <li>Patatap: <a
            href="https://patatap.com"
            target="_blank">https://patatap.com</a><br>
            This website lets you create sounds by using the keys on your keyboard.
            It changes the tone or type of sounds that the keys make if you press
            the spacebare, and has different graphics for each keystroke.</li>
