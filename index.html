        <h3>My Journey To This Class</h3>
        <p>
        I decided to declare Computer Science as my major after taking DIG110
        Spring semester of my freshman year. At that time I had been exposed to
        computer science one other class from senior year of High School. Both
        times I enjoyed the seemingly logical methods of coding and the problem
        solving methods. That same semester I was taking ART111, which is Intro to
        Digital Art. I have never been really good at making art, I don't consider
        myself a creative person, but this class allowed me to experiment easily
        with tools straight from my computer. From there I developed an interest
        for Digital Studies. <br><br>
        I've had a <strong> grand total</strong> of <em>two experiences</em> with
        creating websites. The first was for the ART111 class that I mentioned
        earlier. For our final project we were told to create a portfolio webiste
        with the works we made throughout the semester. This was created using
        WordPress so it was not a very programming heavy process. The other time
        was for the Cypher VII hackathon hosted by the College of William & Mary.
        I was a frontend developer with Kate Hynes for our team called
        "Be the Change". It was both our first time ever creating a website from
        scratch and using HTML and CSS so we had to watch a lot of YouTube videos
        for basic tutorials. Although it was challenging to create a project in
        the given 48 hours, it was a fun experience and I definitely want to
        participate in more hackathons. This being said, I enrolled in this class
        to learn more about web design and to become  more fluent in HTML and CSS
        so that hopefully I will be able to create more website in the future for
        personal projects as well as projects for organizations.

        <p>
        My expectations for this class is to become fluent in HTML and CSS coding
        languages, and learning more about design mechanisms to create a more
        cohesive website and overall better UI. <br><br>
        My goals of the class is to never submit a late assignment and stay
        organized with all my directories on my computer.

        <h3>So Far in DIG254</h3>
        <p>
        The first learn-computing activity I did was keyboard-shortcuts. I knew
        the basic shortcuts like command+v, command+c, command+x, command+tab, but
        this activity gave more broad uses of the shortcuts. It first started off
        by showing the Avid Media Composer helper which is a graphic for all the
        shortcuts used in video editing. There was also a list of more keyboard s
        hortcuts that can be used for a faster work flow in general computer usage.
        Keyboard shortcuts will save time once you learn them well, and will be
        especially helpful for website making since it is such an iterative process.
        <br><br>
        The second learn-computing activity I did was The Filesystem. This
        activity first defined files, folders, programs, force quit, and users.
        Then it talked about how files are organized using the hierarchical
        filesystems. This means that there is an address to each file path, in
        which the paths are much like a node tree. I make this comparison because
        there is a root folder and the folders/files inside those folders are
        like the child of the folder. Then we learned about permission and how to
        view what user has the permission to read, write, and execute. There is a
        table that includes all the extensions of common files and how ot view
        hidden files. Another note to make from this activity is that using iCloud
        is highly discouraged.

        <h3>Intriguing Web-Based Projects</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The Bored Button: <a
            href="https://www.boredbutton.com"
            target="_blank">https://www.boredbutton.com</a> <br>
            This project constantly comes up with links that of fun activities
            and games you can do/play, it's like a randomized online arcade. It's
            basically a website that either finds games for you to play or has a long
          list of games to suggest.</li>
          <li>Hacker Typer: <a
            href="https://hackertyper.net"
            target="_blank">https://hackertyper.net</a> <br>
            This is a fairly simple project, basically what happens is the webiste
            takes any keystroke that a user inputs and adds a specified ammount of
            characters to the screen. There is no correlation to the keys and what
            appears. You can upload files to the website to have a different code
            typed on the screen.</li>
          <li>Patatap: <a
            href="https://patatap.com"
            target="_blank">https://patatap.com</a><br>
            This website lets you create sounds by using the keys on your keyboard.
            It changes the tone or type of sounds that the keys make if you press
            the spacebare, and has different graphics for each keystroke.</li>
